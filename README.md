# test-back-kata-refacto

## Introduction

In this exercice, you have to improve the implementation of the class TemplateManager, by adding tests and refactoring the code.

Assuming the public method `TemplateManager::getTemplateComputed` is called everywhere, 
you must not change the signature of this method.

This exercice should not last longer than 1 hour.

You can run the example file to see the method in action.

## Rules
Some rules to follow :
 - You must commit regularly
 - You must not change code inside Repositories
 - You must not change code where it's written not to do so (see inline code comments)

## Deliverables
We expect from you :
 - the link of the git repository 
 - several commits, with an explicit message each time
 - a file/message/email explaining your process and principles you've followed
